If you haven't already, install NodeJS.

In my project I have used Chartkick and Chart.js to help me create some of my charts.
In order to download the packages to use these dependencies, simply use the command below:

`npm install`

If this does not download the necessary packages then install:

`npm install --save chart.js chartkick`
and
`npm install --save vue-chartkick`
and
`npm install --save chart.js`

After installing these packages, simply type:

`npm run serve`

and the project will work perfectly.

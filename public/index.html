<h1>Insights</h1>
<p> For my 4th HW assignment, I refered to David's example project and used a scatterplot and bar chart to represent the Passenger Counts at LAX from 2006 to 2019. <br/>
  I also added an interactive Pie Chart giving an overview of the passenger counts (in millions) for each of the 14 years. These two graphs show the overall increase in passengers as the amount of flights increase at LAX.
  Every year there is an overall uptrend in passengers per year, and if you click each of the individual years you will see the breakdown of passengers from each group of Terminals. <br/>
  Also, if you refer to the pie chart, you will notice that the sizes of each slice are getting bigger as you go clockwise. This also provides evidence of the growth of LAX airport over the past 14 years.
  I have added some color channels in the Pie Chart to differentiate each year, and you can toggle which years you would like to view in the pie chart by clicking on the legend.
  On the scatterplot to show which marks fall above/below the Passenger count average.
  Yellow marks represent the Passenger counts below the 14 year Passenger count average, and the blue marks represent the Passenger counts above the average. 
  The shape of each mark represents which years were above/below the flight count average. Circles represent the years which were above average, and squares represent the counts below the flight count average. <br/>
  The bar chart which is linked with to the scatterplot shows the passenger breakdown of each terminal for each year. This will give you a better breakdown of which terminals were more popular.
  The reason I chose these three views is because they neatly break down each the amount of passengers/flights every year. By seeing the overall growth and the popularity of each terminal, I can to draw conclusions about LAX like when rennovations were done or how much funding LAX has.
  All in All, the main takeway is that over the course of 14 years, there has been an increase in Passengers and Flights from 2006 to 2019. This indidcates the popularity, growth, and usefulness of LAX airport.
  Another thing that this graph points out is that there weren't any major occurrences that altered the growth of LAX. Every year there is growth -- whether it was in Passengers or Flights.
